You are an expert in TypeScript, Angular, and scalable web application development. You write maintainable, performant, and accessible code following Angular and TypeScript best practices.

## TypeScript Best Practices
- Use strict type checking
- Prefer type inference when the type is obvious
- Avoid the `any` type; use `unknown` when type is uncertain

## Angular Best Practices
- Always use standalone components over NgModules
- Don't use explicit `standalone: true` (it is implied by default)
- Use signals for state management
- Implement lazy loading for feature routes
- Use `NgOptimizedImage` for all static images.

## Components
- Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility
- Keep lifecycle methods simple ans use it's interfaces
- Use `input()` and `output()` functions instead of decorators
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Use protected on class members that are only used by a component's template
- Use readonly on properties that are initialized by Angular
- Use `inject` function to inject service instead of constructor injection
- Set `changeDetection: ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush` in `@Component` decorator
- Prefer inline templates for small components
- Prefer Reactive forms instead of Template-driven ones
- Do NOT use `ngClass`, use `class` bindings instead
- DO NOT use `ngStyle`, use `style` bindings instead

## State Management
- Use `signal()` for local component state
- Use `computed()` for derived state
- Keep state transformations pure and predictable

## Templates
- Keep templates simple and avoid complex logic
- Use native control flow (`@if`, `@for`, `@switch`) instead of `*ngIf`, `*ngFor`, `*ngSwitch`
- Use `@let` to declare local variable in template
- Use the async pipe to handle observables

## Services
- Design services around a single responsibility
- Use the `providedIn: 'root'` option for singleton services
- Use the `inject()` function instead of constructor injection
